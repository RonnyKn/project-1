Frontend Developer Roadmap
This is only a sample and you will need to adjust it depending on how fast or slow you learn. As you progress, you should also keep building up your previous skills.
•	First week - Read an HTML tutorial, then read a CSS tutorial. Create a single page website. Read a new tutorial for HTML and CSS.
•	Second through fourth week - Create a complete, but basic website. It should have a few pages, but nothing fancy. Look at well designed small business websites for inspiration.
•	Second month - Read a JavaScript tutorial, then read a jQuery tutorial. Implement a couple basic effects into the website you just created using jQuery. Try a drop down menu or images that change when you hover over them. Re-implement the same or similar effects with only JavaScript, not jQuery.
•	Third month - Create a new website with JavaScript (or jQuery) in mind. Develop it from start to finish and create the most well designed site you can imagine. You only have four weeks, so it can still be pretty basic.
•	First half of fourth month - Learn a CSS preprocessor. This will help you write maintainable CSS at a faster pace. I suggest learning either Sass or Less. Try re-writing some of your code using this.
•	Second half of fourth month - Learn about HTML templates. A good option is Handlebars.js, but you can do your own research.
•	Last two months - You can either learn about a JavaScript framework or begin working on your portfolio. A portfolio is almost a requirement for most web developer jobs. Create a couple sites that interest you can keep building it up as you create more sites.
